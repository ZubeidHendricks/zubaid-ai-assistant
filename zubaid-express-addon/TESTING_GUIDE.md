## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ZUBAID Doesn't Load
- **Check Console**: F12 → Console tab for error messages
- **Reload Add-on**: Click "Test add-on" again
- **Clear Cache**: Refresh browser page and try again

#### Agents Don't Start
- **Check Input**: Ensure project brief is filled in
- **Button State**: "Let ZUBAID's Team Get Started" should be clickable

#### No Elements Created in Express
- **Document Access**: Check for "ZUBAID Express Controller 2025 initialized"
